# Changes in early, unversioned Typst

## March 28, 2023

- **Breaking changes:**

  - Enumerations now require a space after their marker, that is, `1.ok`
    must now be written as <span class="typ-marker">`1.`</span>` ok`
  - Changed default style for [term lists](/reference/model/terms/):
    Does not include a colon anymore and has a bit more indent

- Command line interface

  - Added `--font-path` argument for CLI
  - Embedded default fonts in CLI binary
  - Fixed build of CLI if `git` is not installed

- Miscellaneous improvements

  - Added support for disabling [matrix](/reference/math/mat/) and
    [vector](/reference/math/vec/) delimiters. Generally with
    <span class="typ-key">`#`</span><span class="typ-key">`set`</span>` math`<span class="typ-punct">`.`</span><span class="typ-func">`mat`</span><span class="typ-punct">`(`</span>`delim`<span class="typ-punct">`:`</span>` `<span class="typ-key">`none`</span><span class="typ-punct">`)`</span>

- Reference and bibliography management

  - [Bibliographies](/reference/model/bibliography/) and
    [citations](/reference/model/cite/) (currently supported styles are
    APA, Chicago Author Date, IEEE, and MLA)
  - You can now [reference](/reference/model/ref/) sections, figures,
    formulas, and works from the bibliography with
    <span class="typ-ref">`@label`</span>
  - You can make an element referenceable with a label:
    - <span class="typ-heading">`= Introduction`</span>` `<span class="typ-label">`<intro>`</span>
    - <span class="typ-math-delim">`$`</span>` A = `<span class="typ-pol">`pi`</span>` r`<span class="typ-math-op">`^`</span>`2 `<span class="typ-math-delim">`$`</span>` `<span class="typ-label">`<area>`</span>

- Introspection system for interactions between different parts of the
  document

  - [`counter`](/reference/introspection/counter/ "`counter`") function
    - Access and modify counters for pages, headings, figures, and
      equations
    - Define and use your own custom counters
    - Time travel: Find out what the counter value was or will be at
      some other point in the document (e.g. when you're building a list
      of figures, you can determine the value of the figure counter at
      any given figure).
    - Counters count in layout order and not in code order
  - [`state`](/reference/introspection/state/ "`state`") function
    - Manage arbitrary state across your document
    - Time travel: Find out the value of your state at any position in
      the document
    - State is modified in layout order and not in code order
  - [`query`](/reference/introspection/query/ "`query`") function
    - Find all occurrences of an element or a label, either in the whole
      document or before/after some location
    - Link to elements, find out their position on the pages and access
      their fields
    - Example use cases: Custom list of figures or page header with
      current chapter title
  - [`locate`](/reference/introspection/locate/ "`locate`") function
    - Determines the location of itself in the final layout
    - Can be accessed to get the `page` and `x`, `y` coordinates
    - Can be used with counters and state to find out their values at
      that location
    - Can be used with queries to find elements before or after its
      location

- New [`measure`](/reference/layout/measure/ "`measure`") function

  - Measure the layouted size of elements
  - To be used in combination with the new `style` function that lets
    you generate different content based on the style context something
    is inserted into (because that affects the measured size of content)

- Exposed content representation

  - Content is not opaque anymore
  - Content can be compared for equality
  - The tree of content elements can be traversed with code
  - Can be observed in hover tooltips or with
    [`repr`](/reference/foundations/repr/ "`repr`")
  - New [methods](/reference/foundations/content/) on content: `func`,
    `has`, `at`, and `location`
  - All optional fields on elements are now settable
  - More uniform field names (`heading.title` becomes `heading.body`,
    `list.items` becomes `list.children`, and a few more changes)

- Further improvements

  - Added [`figure`](/reference/model/figure/ "`figure`") function
  - Added [`numbering`](/reference/math/equation/#parameters-numbering)

    parameters on page function
  - The page function's
    [`header`](/reference/layout/page/#parameters-header) and
    [`footer`](/reference/layout/page/#parameters-footer) parameters do
    not take functions anymore. If you want to customize them based on
    the page number, use the new
    [`numbering`](/reference/layout/page/#parameters-numbering)
    parameter or
    [`counter`](/reference/introspection/counter/ "`counter`") function
    instead.
  - Added

## February 15, 2023

- [Box](/reference/layout/box/) and
  [block](/reference/layout/block/ "block") have gained `fill`,
  `stroke`, `radius`, and `inset` properties
- Blocks may now be explicitly sized, fixed-height blocks can still
  break across pages
- Blocks can now be configured to be
  [`breakable`](/reference/layout/block/#parameters-breakable) or not

  block-level. To integrate them into a paragraph, use a
  [`box`](/reference/layout/box/ "`box`") as with other elements.
- A colon is now required in an "everything" show rule: Write
  <span class="typ-key">`show`</span><span class="typ-punct">`:`</span>` it `<span class="typ-op">`=>`</span>` ..`

## January 30, 2023

[Go to the announcement blog
post.](https://typst.app/blog/2023/january-update)

- New expression syntax in markup/math
  - Blocks cannot be directly embedded in markup anymore
  - Like other expressions, they now require a leading hash
  - More expressions available with hash, including literals
    (<span class="typ-str">`#`</span><span class="typ-str">`"string"`</span>)
    as well as field access and method call without space:
    <span class="typ-pol">`#`</span><span class="typ-pol">`emoji`</span><span class="typ-punct">`.`</span><span class="typ-pol">`face`</span>
- New import syntax
  - <span class="typ-key">`#`</span><span class="typ-key">`import`</span>` `<span class="typ-str">`"module.typ"`</span>
    creates binding named `module`
  - <span class="typ-key">`#`</span><span class="typ-key">`import`</span>` `<span class="typ-str">`"module.typ"`</span><span class="typ-punct">`:`</span>` a`<span class="typ-punct">`,`</span>` b`
    or
    <span class="typ-key">`#`</span><span class="typ-key">`import`</span>` `<span class="typ-str">`"module.typ"`</span><span class="typ-punct">`:`</span>` `<span class="typ-op">`*`</span>
    to import items
  - <span class="typ-key">`#`</span><span class="typ-key">`import`</span>` emoji`<span class="typ-punct">`:`</span>` face`<span class="typ-punct">`,`</span>` turtle`
    to import from already bound module
- New symbol handling
  - Removed symbol notation
  - Symbols are now in modules: `sym`, `emoji`, and `math`
  - Math module also reexports all of `sym`
  - Modified through field access, still order-independent
  - Unknown modifiers are not allowed anymore
  - Support for custom symbol definitions with `symbol` function
  - Symbols now listed in documentation
- New `math` module
  - Contains all math-related functions
  - Variables and function calls directly in math (without hash) access
    this module instead of the global scope, but can also access local
    variables
  - Can be explicitly used in code, e.g.
    <span class="typ-key">`#`</span><span class="typ-key">`set`</span>` math`<span class="typ-punct">`.`</span><span class="typ-func">`vec`</span><span class="typ-punct">`(`</span>`delim`<span class="typ-punct">`:`</span>` `<span class="typ-str">`"["`</span><span class="typ-punct">`)`</span>
- Delimiter matching in math
  - Any opening delimiters matches any closing one
  - When matched, they automatically scale
  - To prevent scaling, escape them
  - To forcibly match two delimiters, use `lr` function
  - Line breaks may occur between matched delimiters
  - Delimiters may also be unbalanced
  - You can also use the `lr` function to scale the brackets (or just
    one bracket) to a specific size manually
- Multi-line math with alignment
  - The `\` character inserts a line break
  - The `&` character defines an alignment point
  - Alignment points also work for underbraces, vectors, cases, and
    matrices
  - Multiple alignment points are supported
- More capable math function calls
  - Function calls directly in math can now take code expressions with
    hash
  - They can now also take named arguments
  - Within math function calls, semicolons turn preceding arguments to
    arrays to support matrices:
    <span class="typ-math-delim">`$`</span><span class="typ-func">`mat`</span><span class="typ-punct">`(`</span>`1`<span class="typ-punct">`,`</span>` 2`<span class="typ-punct">`;`</span>` 3`<span class="typ-punct">`,`</span>` 4`<span class="typ-punct">`)`</span><span class="typ-math-delim">`$`</span>

- More math features
  - New text operators: `op` function, `lim`, `max`, etc.
  - New matrix function: `mat`
  - New n-ary roots with `root` function:
    <span class="typ-math-delim">`$`</span><span class="typ-func">`root`</span><span class="typ-punct">`(`</span>`3`<span class="typ-punct">`,`</span>` x`<span class="typ-punct">`)`</span><span class="typ-math-delim">`$`</span>

  - New `attach` function, overridable attachments with `script` and
    `limit`
  - Manual spacing in math, with `h`, `thin`, `med`, `thick` and `quad`
  - Symbols and other content may now be used like a function, e.g.
    <span class="typ-math-delim">`$`</span><span class="typ-func">`zeta`</span><span class="typ-punct">`(`</span>`x`<span class="typ-punct">`)`</span><span class="typ-math-delim">`$`</span>
  - Added Fira Math font, removed Noto Sans Math font
  - Support for alternative math fonts through
    <span class="typ-key">`#`</span><span class="typ-key">`show`</span>` math`<span class="typ-punct">`.`</span><span class="typ-func">`formula`</span><span class="typ-punct">`:`</span>` `<span class="typ-key">`set`</span>` `<span class="typ-func">`text`</span><span class="typ-punct">`(`</span><span class="typ-str">`"Fira Math"`</span><span class="typ-punct">`)`</span>
- More library improvements
  - New `calc` module, `abs`, `min`, `max`, `even`, `odd` and `mod`
    moved there
  - New `message` argument on `assert` function

    now always fails if `"key"` doesn't exist Previously, it was allowed
    in assignments. Alternatives are
    `dict`<span class="typ-punct">`.`</span>`key `<span class="typ-op">`=`</span>` x`
    and
    `dict`<span class="typ-punct">`.`</span><span class="typ-func">`insert`</span><span class="typ-punct">`(`</span><span class="typ-str">`"key"`</span><span class="typ-punct">`,`</span>` x`<span class="typ-punct">`)`</span>.
