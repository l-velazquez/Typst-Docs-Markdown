# elem

```
html.elem(
    str
    attrs: dictionary
    none content
) -> content
```
An HTML element that can contain Typst content.

Typst's HTML export automatically generates the appropriate tags for
most elements. However, sometimes, it is desirable to retain more
control. For example, when using Typst to generate your blog, you could
use this function to wrap each article in an `<article>` tag.

Typst is aware of what is valid HTML. A tag and its attributes must form
syntactically valid HTML. Some tags, like `meta` do not accept content.
Hence, you must not provide a body for them. We may add more checks in
the future, so be sure that you are generating valid HTML when using
this function.

Normally, Typst will generate `html`, `head`, and `body` tags for you.
If you instead create them with this function, Typst will omit its own
tags.

    #html.elem("div", attrs: (style: "background: aqua"))[
      A div with _Typst content_ inside!
    ]

The element's tag.
