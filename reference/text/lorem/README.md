Creates blind text.

This function yields a Latin-like *Lorem Ipsum* blind text with the
given number of words. The sequence of words generated by the function
is always the same but randomly chosen. As usual for blind texts, it
does not make any sense. Use it as a placeholder to try layouts.

## Example

<div class="previewed-code">

    = Blind Text
    #lorem(30)

    = More Blind Text
    #lorem(15)

<div class="preview">
