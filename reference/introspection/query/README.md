# query

```
query(
    label selector location function
) -> array
```
Finds elements in the document.

The `query` functions lets you search your document for elements of a
particular type or with a particular label. To use it, you first need to
ensure that [context](/reference/context/ "context") is available.

## Finding elements

In the example below, we manually create a table of contents instead of
using the [`outline`](/reference/model/outline/ "`outline`") function.

To do this, we first query for all headings in the document at level 1
and where `outlined` is true. Querying only for headings at level 1
ensures that, for the purpose of this example, sub-headings are not
included in the table of contents. The `outlined` field is used to
exclude the "Table of Contents" heading itself.

Note that we open a `context` to be able to use the `query` function.

<div class="previewed-code">

    #set page(numbering: "1")

    #heading(outlined: false)[
      Table of Contents
    ]
    #context {
      let chapters = query(
        heading.where(
          level: 1,
          outlined: true,
        )
      )
      for chapter in chapters {
        let loc = chapter.location()
        let nr = numbering(
          loc.page-numbering(),
          ..counter(page).at(loc),
        )
        [#chapter.body #h(1fr) #nr \ ]
      }
    }

    = Introduction
    #lorem(10)
    #pagebreak()

    == Sub-Heading
    #lorem(8)

    = Discussion
    #lorem(18)

<div class="preview">

</div>

</div>

To get the page numbers, we first get the location of the elements
returned by `query` with
[`location`](/reference/foundations/content/#definitions-location). We
then also retrieve the [page
numbering](/reference/introspection/location/#definitions-page-numbering)
and [page counter](/reference/introspection/counter/#page-counter) at
that location and apply the numbering to the counter.

## A word of caution

To resolve all your queries, Typst evaluates and layouts parts of the
document multiple times. However, there is no guarantee that your
queries can actually be completely resolved. If you aren't careful a
query can affect itselfâ€”leading to a result that never stabilizes.

In the example below, we query for all headings in the document. We then
generate as many headings. In the beginning, there's just one heading,
titled `Real`. Thus, `count` is `1` and one `Fake` heading is generated.
Typst sees that the query's result has changed and processes it again.
This time, `count` is `2` and two `Fake` headings are generated. This
goes on and on. As we can see, the output has a finite amount of
headings. This is because Typst simply gives up after a few attempts.

In general, you should try not to write queries that affect themselves.
The same words of caution also apply to other introspection features
like [counters](/reference/introspection/counter/) and
[state](/reference/introspection/state/ "state").

<div class="previewed-code">

    = Real
    #context {
      let elems = query(heading)
      let count = elems.len()
      count * [= Fake]
    }

<div class="preview">

</div>

</div>

## Command line queries

You can also perform queries from the command line with the
`typst query` command. This command executes an arbitrary query on the
document and returns the resulting elements in serialized form. Consider
the following `example.typ` file which contains some invisible
[metadata](/reference/introspection/metadata/ "metadata"):

    #metadata("This is a note") <note>

You can execute a query on it as follows using Typst's CLI:

```
$ typst query example.typ "<note>"
[
  {
    "func": "metadata",
    "value": "This is a note",
    "label": "<note>"
  }
]
```

Frequently, you're interested in only one specific field of the
resulting elements. In the case of the `metadata` element, the `value`
field is the interesting one. You can extract just this field with the
`--field` argument.

```
$ typst query example.typ "<note>" --field value
["This is a note"]
```

If you are interested in just a single element, you can use the `--one`
flag to extract just it.

```
$ typst query example.typ "<note>" --field value --one
"This is a note"
```


### Parameters


### target: label, selector, location, function | _required_ _positional_

Can be

- an element function like a `heading` or `figure`,
- a <span class="typ-label">`<label>`</span>,
- a more complex selector like
  `heading`<span class="typ-punct">`.`</span><span class="typ-func">`where`</span><span class="typ-punct">`(`</span>`level`<span class="typ-punct">`:`</span>` `<span class="typ-num">`1`</span><span class="typ-punct">`)`</span>,
- or
  <span class="typ-func">`selector`</span><span class="typ-punct">`(`</span>`heading`<span class="typ-punct">`)`</span><span class="typ-punct">`.`</span><span class="typ-func">`before`</span><span class="typ-punct">`(`</span><span class="typ-func">`here`</span><span class="typ-punct">`(`</span><span class="typ-punct">`)`</span><span class="typ-punct">`)`</span>.

Only [locatable](/reference/introspection/location/#locatable) element
functions are supported.
