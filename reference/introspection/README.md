Interactions between document parts.

This category is home to Typst's introspection capabilities: With the
`counter` function, you can access and manipulate page, section, figure,
and equation counters or create custom ones. Meanwhile, the `query`
function lets you search for elements in the document to construct
things like a list of figures or headers which show the current chapter
title.

Most of the functions are *contextual.* It is recommended to read the
chapter on [context](/reference/context/ "context") before continuing
here.

- [counter](/reference/introspection/counter/) Counts through pages, elements, and more.
- [here](/reference/introspection/here/) Provides the current location in the document.
- [locate](/reference/introspection/locate/) Determines the location of an element in the document.
- [location](/reference/introspection/location/) Identifies an element in the document.
- [metadata](/reference/introspection/metadata/) Exposes a value to the query system without producing visible content.
- [query](/reference/introspection/query/) Finds elements in the document.
- [state](/reference/introspection/state/) Manages stateful parts of your document.
