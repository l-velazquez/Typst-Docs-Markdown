# None

A value that indicates the absence of any other value.

The none type has exactly one value:
<span class="typ-key">`none`</span>.

When inserted into the document, it is not visible. This is also the
value that is produced by empty code blocks. It can be
[joined](/reference/scripting/#blocks) with any value, yielding the
other value.

## Example

<div class="previewed-code">

    Not visible: #none

<div class="preview">
