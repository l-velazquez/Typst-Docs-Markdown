# Fraction

Defines how the remaining space in a layout is distributed.

Each fractionally sized element gets space based on the ratio of its
fraction to the sum of all fractions.

For more details, also see the [h](/reference/layout/h/ "h") and
[v](/reference/layout/v/ "v") functions and the [grid
function](/reference/layout/grid/).
